# Database Added! ✅

## What's New?

Your Shop Mart website now has a **simple database** that automatically saves:

1. **Products** 🛍️
2. **Shopping Cart** 🛒  
3. **Orders** 📦

## Files Added

- `database.js` - Database code (6 simple functions)
- `admin.html` - Admin page to view orders
- `DATABASE_README.md` - Documentation

## How to Use

### For Customers
Nothing changes! Just use the website normally:
- Browse products
- Add to cart
- Checkout

Everything saves automatically!

### For Admin
Open `admin.html` to:
- View all orders
- See products
- Export data

## How It Works

```
1. Open website → Database initializes
2. Add to cart → Saves automatically  
3. Checkout → Order saved
4. Close browser → Data persists!
5. Reopen → Everything still there ✨
```

## Technical Details

**Database:** IndexedDB (browser built-in)  
**Storage:** Local (in browser)  
**Persistence:** Permanent (until cleared)

2. Add items to cart
